# Recipe book

Welcome to your very own recipe book!

This project is a little different. There are hardly any files. There are no
customers clamouring for features. The logo has a carrot with a face.

This project is all about you and your favourite recipes. It's also about
writing and styling semantic HTML. But mostly food.

Here are some things to bear in mind this week:

> [!NOTE]
>
> There aren't any exercises. No tests. Freedom! Treat the deep dive time as an
> extension of the project time.

> [!NOTE]
>
> There are still docs and videos to guide you at the beginning. But that really
> is just the beginning. There is an overwhelming amount of content on the
> internet about how to make more internet. Get creative, branch out, get off
> the beaten path and do something interesting.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Making web pages is very visual, so you are encouraged to share what you've
> been working on with whoever will look at it! If you feel so inclined, you
> could even try hosting your website **for free** through
> [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so you can share a link.

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)
   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)
   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Install the recommended
   [Live Server extension](vscode:extension/ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Running tests

Just kidding.

The "test" will be `Ctrl + Shift + P` and start Live Server so you can take a
look at the changes you're making instantly.

## Day 1

The goal today is to make a recipe book in HTML. It won't look great to begin
with, but we're setting up a solid foundation for a sleek and accessible
website.

- [x] Have a look at
      [how to set up a HTML document](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/html-document.html)

- [x] Find out about
      [HTML elements](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/html-elements.html)

- [x] Learn about
      [semantic HTML](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/semantic-html.html)

- [x] Get introduced to
      [HTML forms](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/html-forms.html)

- [x] Dig out some of your favourite recipes and write them up in HTML. Make
      sure to research and choose the
      [most appropriate elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
      for each part of your page.

- [x] Add a form on your page which would allow users to rate and comment on the
      recipes. How many different
      [field input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types)
      can you include?

For something seemingly simple, there is
[a lot to know about HTML](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/24/).
Once you're happy with your page, you could:

- Read the
  [W3C tutorials on web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/) and
  try to apply their recommendations

- Add
  [some links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)
  to your site. You can link to external sites, or you could add some more pages
  to your own. Maybe you could add an
  "[about me](https://mailchimp.com/resources/how-to-write-about-me-page/)"
  page?

- You can do
  [basic form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
  with HTML alone! Try and add some validation to your form.

## Day 2

The goal today is to make your site beautiful. We'll be using CSS. To begin
with, we'll just try and get the basic layout and styling right, but styling
with CSS is an incredibly deep and fun topic. Keep experimenting with different
techniques and see what you can come up with.

- [ ] Learn the basics of
      [styling elements and classes](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/styling-elements.html)

- [ ] Get acquainted with
      [Flex Box](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/flexbox.html)

- [ ] Flex Box can be a little tricky so spend some time on
      [Flex Box Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) to get the ideas down.

- [ ] Learn how to layout a website using
      [CSS grid](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/html-css/layouts-with-grid.html)

- [ ] [Grid garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) can help you get used to CSS
      grid!

Now for the recipe book! Go ahead and style it any way you like. Make it
beautiful. Make it yours.NOTE If you want to make your form look better,
[MDN have a guide for that](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Styling_web_forms).

Fancy adding some animations? Put

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
/>
```

in the `<head>` of your page and
[follow the guide](https://animate.style/#usage) to animate elements on your
page.

And if you need some inspiration, the good people at
[CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) have created a gold mine of neat things
you can do with CSS.

Have fun!
