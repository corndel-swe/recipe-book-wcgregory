    <h3>Who Am I</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Wayne Gregory, and I am wonderfully curious about the world of Software Development.<br>
            This curiosity has brought me to the point of developing a recipe book online and creating an
            "about me" page.
        </p>
    <p>
        I have spent many years in information technology roles since the turn of the new millenium and have witnessed<br>
        huge technological advances in that time. I have decided that it was the right time to skill up and pivot my <br>
        career to one of continual knowledge gathering, self-development and personal growth.

        I would like to thank the kind and patient instructors at Corndel for helping me gain a new super power.
